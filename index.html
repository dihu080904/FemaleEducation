        <h1 style ="text-align:center;"><bold> Development of Chinese Female Education: 1998-2017</bold></h1>
        <p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;word-spacing: 3px;">As we know, China was casting great highlights on Male towards many things including Education, Employment, Family and so on. Based on what I am interested in, I picked Education to delve into. I found that as China develops faster and faster financially, the bias in genders of education has become less prominent. Before, Bachelor degrees conferred to Male are way past half of students number than ones conferred to Female. I want to address this phenomenon because I think although the bias was reduced, it was not stopped. Some parts of China (more like rural parts), still have more preference towards boys over girls when it comes to newly born child, let alone College admissions (for these families would tend to not let their female children get further education). I would want to show Chinese people these data and let them know that Female education is just as important as Male's and equality between sex genders is crucial.</p>
